Step 1: Understanding the business problem or questions. Planning the process to execute the project.
Step 2: Set up a database by merging all the available datasets. Save the file named 'Python Script for Inventory on VS Code.ipynb'->'ingestion_db.py'. Run it, result: 'inventory' database got created. This creates a 'ingestion_db.log' file when run.
Step 3: Start EDA, name the python notebook as 'Exploratory Data Analysis.ipnyb'. Save the script as 'get_vendor_summary.py'.
Step 4: Data analysis using Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, SciPy), save the file as 'Liqour-Brand Sales Analysis'. Create the PDF report 'Liqour-Brand Sales Report' based on the results.
Step 5: Extract the 'vendor_sales_summary' table from the 'inventory' and use it for creating Power BI dashboard.
